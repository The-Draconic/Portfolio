# Portfolio Introduction
Hello, I like to call myself **The Draconic**, or just **Draco**. I'm a computer science major and film minor looking for fun ways to exhibit my world building, such as video games, films, etc. This repository will be for projects done in classes or for fun!

## Purpose for Portfolio
The purpose for making this portfolio is to both display different projects I have and will do and to receive critic for them in order to improve on them and to also experiment with fun little ideas in code.
